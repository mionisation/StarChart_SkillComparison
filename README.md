# Estimation of the development of my skills during Data Science internship

This shows my self-assessed current skill set and how I see myself after the Arch Fast Track scheme. I am sure that I will greatly improve my skills overall – especially my Business, communications and problem solving skills. I assessed “Innovation” a bit lower, as I think that takes a long time to master. The skills were selected from a list of crucial skills for Data Scientists.
